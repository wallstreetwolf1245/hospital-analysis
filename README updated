# Hospital Data Analysis and Preprocessing

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for exploring, cleaning, and preprocessing a hospital dataset. The project aims to prepare the data for machine learning model development (e.g., predicting hospital readmissions). In this notebook, we:
- **Explore the Data:** Load the dataset, examine its structure, identify missing values, and review summary statistics.
- **Clean the Data:** Remove duplicate rows, handle missing values by filling them with appropriate values, convert data types as needed, and detect potential outliers.
- **Analyze the Data:** Visualize key trends and relationships between features to gain insights.

## Dataset
- **Filename:** `hospData_NA.csv`
- **Source:** Downloaded from Kaggle (ensure the CSV file is in the same directory as the notebook).
- **Description:** The dataset contains hospital-related data. Specific details about the features should be referenced from the dataset description on Kaggle.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.x** installed on your computer.
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab** installed.
- The following Python libraries installed:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
